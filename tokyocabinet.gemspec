    s.description= "Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database.  The
      database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a
      value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length.  Both binary data
      and character string can be used as a key and a value.  There is neither concept
      of data tables nor data types.  Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or
      fixed-length array. Miguel Vazquez introduced a small modification to make it work 
      on ruby 1.9."
